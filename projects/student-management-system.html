		<h2>I created the Student Management System (SMS) for my Computing A-Level final project.</h2>
		<div class="showcase-container">
			<div><img src="../img/sms/mainform-menu.JPG" width="100%"/></div>
			<div><p>The program was written in Pascal, and implemented with Delphi and Microsoft ADO DB for the database backend. It was created according to the needs and wishes of the target user, a local French tutor, and I followed the complete system maintenance cycle when realising the project.</p></div>

		<h2>The Write-up</h2>
		<p>As part of the project, I had to document every part of the work - from initial analysis of current systems and the potential users, to designing the data and interface, creating test plans and also detailing the user's feedback.</p>
		<p>Including the code listing for the project, my writeup comes to just over two hundred pages long, as well as an additional user manual which guides the user through the program's various features and settings. If you wish to obtain a copy of these, please email me by <a href="../about.html">contacting me</a>.</p>
