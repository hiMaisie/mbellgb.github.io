# Education
I'm studying for a computer science master's degree at University College London. I averaged a first during my first year and am on track to complete my second year at the same standard.

I wrote some thoughts on my first year of computer science, which you can read on my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@mbell_gb/computer-science-pitfalls-be95017ad1bf#.60rykzv0e).

## UCLU TechSoc
I served as part of the [TechSoc](http://techsoc.io/) committee between March and October 2016. I led the marketing team and helped with some of the organisation for [Porticode](http://porticode.io), TechSoc's own hackathon.

# Hackathons
I aim to go to as many hackathons as I can- they're an awesome way of trying out new tech and meeting new people with similar interests! A selection of my submitted projects are on my [Devpost profile](https://devpost.com/mbell). Here's a definitive list of what I've been up to

## 2016

* **Junction (upcoming)** -- Helsinki, Finland.

* **LauzHack (upcoming)** -- Lausanne, Switzerland. Supporting the hackathon by volunteering and mentoring.
