I completed a BSc Computer Science degree from University College London in

made so many new friends, skills, and memories.

I wrote some thoughts on my first year of computer science, which you can read

[Medium blog](https://medium.com/@mbellgb/computer-science-pitfalls-be95017ad1bf#.60rykzv0e).
