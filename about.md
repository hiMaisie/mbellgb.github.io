# Education

I'm studying for a computer science bachelor's degree at University College
London. I'm currently on track to obtain a 2:1 degree by July 2018.

I wrote some thoughts on my first year of computer science, which you can read
on my
[Medium blog](https://medium.com/@mbellgb/computer-science-pitfalls-be95017ad1bf#.60rykzv0e).

## UCLU TechSoc

I served as part of the [TechSoc](http://techsoc.io/) committee between March
and October 2016. I led the marketing team and helped with some of the
organisation for [Porticode](http://porticode.io), TechSoc's own hackathon.
