# Education
I'm studying for a computer science master's degree at University College London. I averaged a first during my first year and am on track to complete my second year at the same standard.

I wrote some thoughts on my first year of computer science, which you can read on my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@mbell_gb/computer-science-pitfalls-be95017ad1bf#.60rykzv0e).

## UCLU TechSoc
I served as part of the [TechSoc](http://techsoc.io/) committee between March and October 2016. I led the marketing team and helped with some of the organisation for [Porticode](http://porticode.io), TechSoc's own hackathon.
