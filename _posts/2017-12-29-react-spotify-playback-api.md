The [Spotify for Developers](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/) team
recently released a beta version of their new [web playback
API](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/community/news/2017/12/11/announcing-the-web-playback-sdk/),
and I've been having a play around with it over the Christmas week. It's been
a lot of fun, and small bugs aside, surprisingly straightforward to work
with.

This project will be focusing purely on getting the API working, so we won't
be focusing on styling or anything beyond a basic player with controls and a
"now playing" display. I've hosted the finished code on Glitch---you can find
the link below---where you're free to edit remix your own copy to your heart's
content.

# Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have some knowledge of Javacript, the browser
development console, React and how APIs work. If you want to learn about
these topics, there's a few resources online I really recommend:

## Javascript

* [Codecademy's Introduction to
  Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
  course is fantastic for first-time Javascript users, or if you need a refresh
  of the fundamentals.
* [JavaScript â€” Just another introduction to
  ES6](https://medium.com/sons-of-javascript/javascript-an-introduction-to-es6-1819d0d89a0f)
  is a fantastic introduction to more modern "ES6" features of Javsacript.
* [You Don't Know
  JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/es6%20%26%20beyond#you-dont-know-js-es6--beyond)
  covers the above in a lot more detail, it's very good as a reference to come
  back to.
* [Javascript Promises For
  Dummies](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-promises-for-dummies) is my
  favourite article for explaining how to use Promises, `async`, and `await` in
  Javascript and why you might want to.
* [How to Use the JavaScript Fetch API to Get
  Data](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data)
  is a great introduction to using the `fetch` API instead of other methods you
  may have seen.

## React

* [Codecademy: Learn ReactJS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101) is an
  interactive tutorial for getting to grips with React.
* [The official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) is
  also not a bad option.
* [Thinking In React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) is
  another React-made resource, which helps to explain how to tackle your
  problem, React style.

# Setting Up

The first step is to create your project. If you're doing this locally, I
recommend using the `create-react-app` to get started (learn more
[here](https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html)).
Otherwise, if you're following along using Glitch, you can simply remix [this
example React app](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/create-react-app-sample) and
you're good to go (follow the instructions in the `README` file though!)

![The app created by create-react-app](/assets/img/react-spotify-playback/create-react-app.png)

We'll then start editing the app so that we can store all the information
that we need:

* An API token that we'll provide to the Spotify API so that we can log in with
  a Spotify account,
* a device ID that represents this web browser as a "Spotify player",
* a boolean value showing whether we're trying to logged in or not (along with
  an error message if something goes wrong).
* the track name, artists' names, and album name,
* whether the player is currently paused or playing a track (we'll use this to
  change the play/pause button),
* the current progress of the track.

So, let's open `src/App.js`, and set the state of the App component, setting
these default values:

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      token: "",
      deviceId: "",
      loggedIn: false,
      error: "",
      trackName: "Track Name",
      artistName: "Artist Name",
      albumName: "Album Name",
      playing: false,
      position: 0,
      duration: 0,
    };
  }
  render() {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

We'll also edit the `render()` method so that we can display a text box and a
button for the user to enter their Spotify access token.

```javascript
render() {
  const { token } = this.state;

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div className="App-header">
        <h2>Now Playing</h2>
      </div>
      <p className="App-intro">
        Enter your Spotify access token. Get it from{" "}
        <a href="https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/#authenticating-with-spotify">
          here
        </a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <input type="text" value={token} onChange={e => this.setState({ token: e.target.value })} />
      </p>
      <p>
        <button>Go</button>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We then need to update the page to show the form only if the user isn't
logged into Spotify. We can do this by checking for the `loggedIn` state
variable.

On the "logged in" screen, we'll also display the currently playing track.

I also went to the courtesy of printing out the error value if it gets set,
which should hopefully make fixing problems a lot easier further down the
line.

```javascript
render() {
  const {
    token,
    loggedIn,
    artistName,
    trackName,
    albumName,
    error,
    position,
    duration,
    playing,
  } = this.state;

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div className="App-header">
        <h2>Now Playing</h2>
        <p>A Spotify Web Playback API Demo.</p>
      </div>

      {error && <p>Error: {error}</p>}

      {loggedIn ?
      (<div>
        <p>Artist: {artistName}</p>
        <p>Track: {trackName}</p>
        <p>Album: {albumName}</p>
      </div>)
      :
      (<div>
        <p className="App-intro">
          Enter your Spotify access token. Get it from{" "}
          <a href="https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/#authenticating-with-spotify">
            here
          </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <input type="text" value={token} onChange={e => this.setState({ token: e.target.value })} />
        </p>
        <p>
          <button onClick={() => this.handleLogin()}>Go</button>
        </p>
      </div>)
      }
    </div>
  );
}
```

You may have noticed that we referenced a new method for the App component,
`handleLogin()`, which is called when the user clicks on the "Go" button. For
now, this just updates the state to set `loggedIn` to true.

```javascript
handleLogin() {
  if (this.state.token !== "") {
    this.setState({ loggedIn: true });
  }
}
```

![The login form, showing the text input and a button to log in.](/assets/img/react-spotify-playback/login-form.png)

# Connecting the Spotify API

The next step is to connect this up to the Spotify API. If you visit the
API's quick [start
page](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/),
under the "Installing the SDK" section, there's a `<script>` tag in the code
which we'll use. Paste this into the `public/index.html` file, and add this
little script tag too:

```html
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <!-- ... -->
  <script src="https://sdk.scdn.co/spotify-player.js"></script>
  <script>
    window.onSpotifyWebPlaybackSDKReady = () => {
      window.Spotify = Spotify;
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

The first script tag loads the playback SDK into the browser window. The
second one assigns a window variable, called `Spotify`, to the global
`Spotify` variable, inside the `window.onSpotifyWebPlaybackSDKReady` method.
This method is called by the javascript file we just linked when it has
finished loading, so we know by this point, we can happily use the `Spotify`
variable without any trouble.

Setting `window.Spotify` may seem a little odd. The reason we do this is
because React runs on its own copy of the web page's HTML (for performance
reasons, mostly). So it isn't actually able to see the global `Spotify`
variable! Therefore, we add it to the `window` object as this can be accesed
by React.

Now, if we go back to `src/App.js`, we can now create a method to check for this
variable, and if it exists, to create the `Player` object---this is what we'll
use to send/receive most data to and from Spotify.

```javascript
checkForPlayer() {
  const { token } = this.state;

  if (window.Spotify !== null) {
    this.player = new window.Spotify.Player({
      name: "Matt's Spotify Player",
      getOAuthToken: cb => { cb(token); },
    });
    // this.createEventHandlers();

    // finally, connect!
    this.player.connect();
  }
}
```

This example works pretty much identically to how the
[documentation](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/#initializing-the-sdk)
recommends setting things up, but instead of using a constant OAuth token,
we're taking it from our app component's state, and instead of creating a
global variable called `player`, we just add `player` as one of the app's
class variables. This means that we can access it from any of the other class
methods.

Finally, after adding our event handlers (we'll come onto that shortly) we can
then connect to the player!

One more thing we need to do is to run the `checkForPlayer()` method repeatedly
until the SDK is ready. For this, we'll use `setInterval` to run the method
repeatedly. Add a new variable for this interval in the constructor, so that we
can cancel the interval later on:

```javascript
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
    /* ... etc ... */
  };
  /* create the variable */
  this.playerCheckInterval = null;
}
```

And then we'll create the interval inside our button click handler.

```javascript
handleLogin() {
  if (this.state.token !== "") {
    this.setState({ loggedIn: true });
    // check every second for the player.
    this.playerCheckInterval = setInterval(() => this.checkForPlayer(), 1000);
  }
}
```

This will now run the player checking method every second (1000 ms). Of course,
once it is created, we need to destroy the interval. So in the
`checkForPlayer()`, we need to add this:

```javascript
checkForPlayer() {
  const { token } = this.state;

  if (window.Spotify !== null) {
    // cancel the interval
    clearInterval(this.playerCheckInterval);
    /* etc... */
  }
}
```

## Handling Events

Now is a good time to set up our event handlers, so we can update our app
whenever something is received from the API. Let's create another class method,
call `createEventHandlers()`:

```javascript
createEventHandlers() {
  this.player.on('initialization_error', e => { console.error(e); });
  this.player.on('authentication_error', e => {
    console.error(e);
    this.setState({ loggedIn: false });
  });
  this.player.on('account_error', e => { console.error(e); });
  this.player.on('playback_error', e => { console.error(e); });

  // Playback status updates
  this.player.on('player_state_changed', state => { console.log(state); });

  // Ready
  this.player.on('ready', data => {
    let { device_id } = data;
    console.log("Let the music play on!");
    this.setState({ deviceId: device_id });
  });
}
```

For now, we'll just print out all information to the developer console.
Notice also, that if there's an authentication error, we set the `loggedIn`
state variable to false. This will take us back to the login page so that we
can log in again with a new token. This is because we'll most likely get this
error if the token is incorrect, or if it has expired (these tokens will only
last an hour).

Oh, and remember to uncomment the call to `createEventHandlers()` in the
`checkForPlayer()` method!

```javascript
clearInterval(this.playerCheckInterval);
this.player = new window.Spotify.Player({
  name: "Matt's Spotify Player",
  getOAuthToken: cb => {
    cb(token);
  },
});
this.createEventHandlers();
```

Now, let's give this a try. Go to the Spotify [documentation
page](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/#authenticating-with-spotify),
and click the button to "get your web playback SDK access token". Sign in
with your Spotify account and you'll get your access token:

![Spotify SDK access token screen, with the actual token blurred out for security reasons.](/assets/img/react-spotify-playback/token.png)

Now go to your app, and press F12 (or equivalent) to show the developer
console. Pop the token you just received into the text box and press go.
Hopefully you will then see your success message appear!

![Message in the console indicated a successful connection](/assets/img/react-spotify-playback/success.png)

Now, if you open a Spotify app on any of your devices and start playing some
music, you should be able to click on the "devices" menu, and see your app
there. Give it a click and you should then be hearing the music come from
your browser!

![List of Spotify devices, showinng my new app!](/assets/img/react-spotify-playback/device-list.png)

You'll also get some interesting information in the console.

![Debugging information appearing in the console, showing the current state of the player.](/assets/img/react-spotify-playback/console-state.png)

This is the Spotify player's "state", which shows information like the
current track, tracks coming up, current volume, whether shuffle and repeat
modes are on, and more. We'll now use this to set our app component's state
variables.

You can find out more about the player state object and the information you
can get out of it
[here](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/reference/#object-playbackstate).

# Showing Now Playing Information

We need to handle this player state object to update our app's own state. To
do this, we'll create a new method called `onStateChanged()`:

```javascript
onStateChanged(state) {
  // if we're no longer listening to music, we'll get a null state.
  if (state !== null) {
    const {
      current_track: currentTrack,
      position,
      duration,
    } = state.track_window;
    const trackName = currentTrack.name;
    const albumName = currentTrack.album.name;
    const artistName = currentTrack.artists
      .map(artist => artist.name)
      .join(", ");
    const playing = !state.paused;
    this.setState({
      position,
      duration,
      trackName,
      albumName,
      artistName,
      playing
    });
  }
}
```

This is quite self-explanatory in that it takes the player state object we
just received, and picks out the bits of information we're interested in,
before calling `setState()` to update the app component's state. One thing to
note is that, rather than providing the track artists' names as a string, we
receive a list of "artist objects". So a little bit of functional javascript
formats this into a string for us to print out.

Then, we'll need to update the `player_state_changed` event handler so that
we call our new method:

```javascript
createEventHandlers() {
  /* ... */
  this.player.on('player_state_changed', state => this.onStateChanged(state));
  /* ... */
}
```

Now, if you log in again with your token, and switch your player to your app
using another Spotify app, you should now be able to see information about
the currently playing song!

![A screenshot of our app, showing the currently playing song](/assets/img/react-spotify-playback/now-playing.png)

# Adding Player Controls

What's the use of a music player if we can't control the music? The next step
for us to is to create play, previous and next buttons. Let's update the now
playing section, inside the `render` method:

```javascript
<p>Artist: {artistName}</p>
<p>Track: {trackName}</p>
<p>Album: {albumName}</p>
<p>
  <button>Previous</button>
  <button>{playing ? "Pause" : "Play"}</button>
  <button>Next</button>
</p>
```

We've added three new buttons to control the player, with the label of the
play/pause button changing depending on if the music is playing or not.

Let's now wire these buttons up to methods so that they actually do something!
We'll create a new method for each button:

```javascript
onPrevClick() {
  this.player.previousTrack();
}

onPlayClick() {
  this.player.togglePlay();
}

onNextClick() {
  this.player.nextTrack();
}
```

And we also need to update our actual buttons to use these new methods:

```javascript
<button onClick={() => this.onPrevClick()}>Previous</button>
<button onClick={() => this.onPlayClick()}>{playing ? "Pause" : "Play"}</button>
<button onClick={() => this.onNextClick()}>Next</button>
```

Now if you log in and get some music going, these buttons should now all
work! There's a lot more to the Spotify Web Playback API than just this, so I
definitely recommend that you check out the
[documentation](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/reference/)
to find out about all the information you can get about the player's state,
as well as the commands you can send to it. As well as this, there is also
the existing (and also very good) Web API that allows you to get and set more
player settings than you're able to with the playback API. The best bit is
that the access token you use for the Playback API will work with the Web API
too, so you'll only need to get the token once. Spotify also provides a full
OAuth flow, so if you connect your app with a server, you can let users log
in straight to Spotify and not have to worry about copying tokens around!

# Extension: Automatically Playing Music From The App

So one thing that you may have found annoying was having to go into one of
your Spotify apps to select the web player to hear music. The good news is
that you can do this through the Spotify Web API! Since it's still in beta,
it sometimes doesn't work because of a known bug (it's being worked on), but
for the most part works well. The API endpoint we'll be using is the
`/v1/me/player`
[endpoint](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/player/transfer-a-users-playback/).

Let's make a new method in our app to handle this. We're using the device ID we
received when we first connected the player, which is a unique identifier for
the web app:

```javascript
transferPlaybackHere() {
  const { deviceId, token } = this.state;
  fetch("https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player", {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: {
      authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      "device_ids": [ deviceId ],
      "play": true,
    }),
  });
}
```

The `play` variable we sent to the API endpoint is set to true here so that,
as documented on Spotify's website, the music will start playing regardless
of whether it was paused by the user on another device beforehand.

The final step is to call this new method when our player connects:

```javascript
createEventHandlers() {
  /* ... */
  // Ready
  this.player.on('ready', async data => {
    let { device_id } = data;
    console.log("Let the music play on!");
    await this.setState({ deviceId: device_id });
    this.transferPlaybackHere();
  });
}
```

There's a small issue here---the `transferPlayBackHere()` method grabs the
device ID from the app component's state. However, the `setState` method does
not instantly update the app's state. However, since it returns a Promise, we
can just make the function asynchronous by adding the `async` keyword before
the function declaration (`async data => {}`), and then adding the `await`
keyword before the `setState()` call. We can then add the
`transferPlaybackHere()` call, safe in the knowledge that the device ID
variable will be set!

And now, if you're listening to Spotify on any device and log into the web
app, the music should automatically switch over to the web app! The main
caveat here is that Spotify will only let you listen on one device per
account at a time. The advantage of this though is that you can control any
device's playback from the other devices. So essentially, you could use the
Web API to build a remote controller for your media center if you wanted. I'm
currently working on building a website where you can join rooms with other
people and listen to a collaborative playlist at the same time, for example.
I'll release the code and a demo as soon as I have a working version
available :smile:

# Extending The App

There's a lot of possible things you could do to take your new app further. Here's some ideas:

* Improve the style and layout of the app to look nicer, perhaps grabbing the
  album art from the player's state
* We currently only get player state updates when the track is paused or
  changed, or the volume adjusted. Perhaps add a `setTimeout()` method that
  calls the player's
  [getCurrentState](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/reference/#api-spotify-player-getcurrentstate)
  method to get more frequent updates?
* Creating a progress bar using the provided `position` and `duration` variables
* Splitting up the code into components and containers so that it's easier to
  manage
* Writing a small server to deal with user sign-ins---using Spotify's
  [authorization
  system](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)
* Better error handling, including showing an error to the user if they get
  signed out.
* Adding components that let the user search for songs and add them to the play
  queue.
* Do something interesting with the [Audio Features
  API](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/)...?
* Remake [this](https://devpost.com/software/spicy-gif-memes) app using the
  Spotify API
