One of the things I find incredibly interesting is the variation of people
who you end up sitting next to on a flight. Some are friendly and approach
you to have a chat with. Some prefer to stay silent for the flight (the
dream). Some will give you really useful advice. Others give you really bad
advice. And then, there's those who are just straight up creepy.
