During Summer 2016, one of my tasks as the [UCLU TechSoc](https://techsoc.io)
(now UCL TechSoc) marketing director was to improve the logo and overall society
visual design. My final design updates were a result of me working with the rest
of the society and getting valuable feedback from the team to create a cleaner
logo and to make the visual design much more welcoming for students of all
backgrounds, not just technology backgrounds.
