The Atos Recruit Platform is a web app created with Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL to create a fast, interesting portal for graduates to apply for jobs. They complete tasks created by the recruiter to earn points, which are also rewarded by the recruiter. This gamification aims to make the job application process a little more engaging for the applicants.
