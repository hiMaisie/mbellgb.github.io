		<h1>A better wallet experience for your Windows Phone.</h1>
		<div class="showcase-container">
			<div><p>10Pass for Windows is not just a place to create items for your Windows Phone wallet. 10Pass will replace it, allowing you to add items, view them and pin them to your start screen, and edit them as you see fit.</p></div>
		</div>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Bring your existing passes too!</h1>
		<div class="showcase-container">
			<div><p>10Pass includes a tool to import your passes from Apple Passbook files, meaning that you do not need to carry two phones with you!</p>
			<p>What's more, you can fine-tune the design of your pass using the built-in designer tool.</p></div>
		</div>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Let us let you know when something important happens.</h1>
		<div><p>10Pass is set to receive push notifications as soon as your passes do as well. 10Pass also supports geofences, so a notification will appear in your action centre when you are near a relevant place.</p></div>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Get 10Pass:</h1>
		<p>10Pass is currently in testing, but get ready for a beta very soon!</p>
