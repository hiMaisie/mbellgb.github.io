	<section>
		<p>I'm an 18 year old student currently living in the South of England. I'm currently studying a computer science degree at university. I've been using computers since I was about three, when our family got a Windows 98 box. Since then I've made countless prototype websites and programs, and have broken my computer too many times to count.</p>

		<h2>My Tech</h2>
		<p>It's no secret that I am a huge geek. Both my desktop and laptop dual boot Windows 10 and Arch Linux, the latter of which I use the i3 Window Manager. I also own two Raspberry Pis and an Arduino kit, which are both rather interesting to destroy.</p>

		<h2>Music</h2>
		<p>Well, I don't actually make music! I do love to listen to it though. I have many playlists saved away on various websites which I listen to contantly. A list of my playlists can be found on my blog, under the music tag.</p>
